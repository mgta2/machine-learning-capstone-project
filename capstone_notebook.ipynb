    "Desire to pursue higher education gave the largest coefficient (with 3.07). This exceeded 'studytime' which was 1.42. Of course, study time is self-reported while aiming for higher education is not ambiguous. Quality of familial relations gave a coefficient of 1.80, making is appear more important than time spent studying. The final two coefficients above 1 were 'Medu' and 'Fedu' - level of education of the student's mother and father. This result is unsurprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other unsurprising positive correlations include student age, whether their parents are still cohabiting, and whether or not the student attended nursery. Students living in urban environments did better, as did those with a home internet connection. Perhaps this is because these factors may indicate wealthier parents who are more likely to have a better education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, the data suggests that students with a longer travel time perform better, though the coefficient is rather small at 0.66. Students who attended extra-ciricular activities also performed slightly better with a coefficient of 0.52. Lastly, students with a family size of less than or equal to 3 had more academic success. This could be because each child gets more parental attention, or it could be an indicator of the family's social class."

However, the model may fair better when it comes to simply categorising the students into pass/fail.\n",

    "This is a very encouraging result. While the model isn't very good at predicting the student's G3 score, it can predict with 84% accuracy whether or not the student will pass/fail, based purely on the data given in school reports and questionnaries. This could make it very easy for teachers to identify 'at risk' students and provide extra academic help as required."
