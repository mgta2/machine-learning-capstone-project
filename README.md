# Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project

My final project of Coding Nomads' https://codingnomads.co/courses/data-science-machine-learning-course. This course uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Student Performance Analysis

My project uses the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance to try to understand how different factors in a student's life can influence their academic results. This is done by using Gradient Descent to build a linear regression model and analysing the resulting model's coefficients.
